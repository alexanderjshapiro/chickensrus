- **Attendance:** Alex, Chelsea, Davis
- **Updates:**
    - Team created four functional requirements, two non-functional requirements, and two use cases each
    - Alex will initialize Flask project, implement functional requirements related to users and accounts, and add meeting summary to MEETINGS
    - Chelsea will implement functional requirements related to listings and create GANTT chart
    - Davis will implement base template using Bootstrap
    - Jordan will implement other templates using Bootstrap
- **Summary:** We split up the functional requirements so each team member could focus on a different area of the website. We expect to rotate which area we are working on later so that each team member has a chance to make changes in each area and learn how it works.
